# CRI Deliverable Map

## Purpose

This ledger tracks **key deliverable units** for the CRI project and connects them to triggers, decisions, and evidence. It implements the "deliverable unit" pattern used in [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/CRDB-Deliverable-Map.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/CRDB-Deliverable-Map.md) and supports end-to-end traceability from question or requirement to submission, for **DCCE / CRI**.

## Usage and maintenance

- Focus on **high-leverage deliverables** (methodology packs, hearing summaries, indicator designs, governance notes) rather than every micro-note.
- Add one row when a deliverable becomes operationally important (drafting, review, or submission).
- When a deliverable supersedes a previous one, add a new row and reference the earlier ID in **Notes**; do not delete older rows.
- Keep links consistent with:
  - triggers in [`CRI-Trigger-Log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/CRI-Trigger-Log.md)
  - evidence in [`output/CRI-Evidence-Registry.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/CRI-Evidence-Registry.md) and the coverage map [`output/CRI-Evidence-Coverage-Map.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/CRI-Evidence-Coverage-Map.md)
  - submissions in [`CRI-Submission-Log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/CRI-Submission-Log.md)
  - any CRI decision / change logs introduced in later steps

> [!pattern]
> Treat this file as the **canonical index for CRI deliverables**. It should answer "what exists", "what is planned", and "how it connects" without requiring readers to scan all folders.

## Practical reading order

1. Start here to identify **which CRI deliverables exist** and which are planned.
2. For a given deliverable row, follow:
   - **Related triggers** → [`CRI-Trigger-Log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/CRI-Trigger-Log.md)
   - **Decision dependencies** → CRI decision / change logs (once established)
   - **Evidence basis** → [`output/CRI-Evidence-Registry.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/CRI-Evidence-Registry.md) and the coverage map
3. Use [`CRI-Submission-Log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/CRI-Submission-Log.md) to see when a deliverable was actually sent or frozen.
