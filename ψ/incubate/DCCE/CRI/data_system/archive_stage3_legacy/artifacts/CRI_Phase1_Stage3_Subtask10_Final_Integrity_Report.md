# CRI Phase 1 Stage 3 — Subtask 10 Final Integrity Report

## Scope
Final integrity pass over Stage 3 artifacts (Subtasks 4–9): schema/key-path inspection, foreign-key integrity, reconciliation consistency, artifact readability, and inherited blocker inventory.

## Execution
- Script: `script/tmp_stage3_subtask10_final_integrity_audit.py`
- Environment: project virtual environment (`.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`)

## Result Status
- `PARTIAL_PASS_WITH_EXPLICIT_FAILURES`
- FK checks: 7/7 passed
- Reconciliation checks: 5/6 passed
- Artifact readability: 23/23 readable

## Integrity Artifacts Produced
- `artifacts/reports/stage3_subtask10_final_integrity_schema_inspection.json`
- `artifacts/reports/stage3_subtask10_final_integrity_fk_checks.csv`
- `artifacts/reports/stage3_subtask10_final_integrity_reconciliation_checks.csv`
- `artifacts/reports/stage3_subtask10_final_integrity_artifact_readability.csv`
- `artifacts/reports/stage3_subtask10_final_integrity_inherited_blockers.json`
- `artifacts/reports/stage3_subtask10_final_integrity_validation.json`

## Inherited Blockers
The final pass preserves known inherited constraints from Subtasks 2/6/8/9 without silent correction; see `stage3_subtask10_final_integrity_inherited_blockers.json`.
