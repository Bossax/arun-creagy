# Indicator Concept Register — NotebookLM Capacity Dictionary v2

This is the local synthesis register for the refreshed v2 pipeline.

## Boundary reminder

- Do not paste raw NotebookLM dumps directly into this register.
- Update this file only after raw responses have been saved under [`responses/`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/notebooklm_capacity_dictionary_v2/responses/).
- Harmonisation, de-duplication, local canonical label choice, QC, and register maintenance happen here, not in NotebookLM.

## Current state

- Pilot-only harmonisation completed (P1, P2-pilot, P3-pilot).
- **Batch M1 (Methodological)** integrated 2026-04-08.
- **Batch F1 (Frameworks)** integrated 2026-04-08.

## Intake queue

- [x] Local Pass 1 raw pilot rows available in [`responses/2026-04-08_pilot_pass1_local_raw_rows.json`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/notebooklm_capacity_dictionary_v2/responses/2026-04-08_pilot_pass1_local_raw_rows.json)
- [x] NotebookLM Pass 2 raw pilot response (Note: Superseded by M1 for methodological core)
- [x] NotebookLM Pass 3 raw pilot response
- [x] Batch M1 (Methodological) saved verbatim in [`responses/2026-04-08_batch_M1_methodological_notebooklm_raw.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/notebooklm_capacity_dictionary_v2/responses/2026-04-08_batch_M1_methodological_notebooklm_raw.md)
- [x] Batch F1 (Frameworks) saved verbatim in [`responses/2026-04-08_batch_F1_framework_notebooklm_raw.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/notebooklm_capacity_dictionary_v2/responses/2026-04-08_batch_F1_framework_notebooklm_raw.md)
- [x] Batch A1 (Adjacency) saved verbatim in [`responses/2026-04-08_batch_A1_adjacency_notebooklm_raw.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/notebooklm_capacity_dictionary_v2/responses/2026-04-08_batch_A1_adjacency_notebooklm_raw.md)

## Traceability convention

 - `P1-xx`: Pilot Pass 1 (Local Paste)
 - `M1-xx`: Batch M1 (Methodological Core) - refer to row index in raw response.
 - `F1-xx`: Batch F1 (Framework Core) - refer to row index in raw response.
 - `A1-xx`: Batch A1 (Adjacency/Operational) - refer to row index in raw response.
 - `P2-xx` / `P3-xx`: Pilot-phase NotebookLM runs (being phased out by M/F/A batches).

## Framing evidence retained but not yet collapsed

- `M1-01`: Five categories of indicators: targets, inputs, outputs, outcomes, impacts.
- `M1-02`: Five most used dimensions: social, economic, environmental, infrastructure, governance.
- `M1-08, M1-09, M1-10`: Systematic list of indicators for adaptive, absorptive, and transformative capacity (Zeng et al., 2022).
- `M1-11, M1-12, M1-13, M1-14`: Resilience attributes: Flexible, Resourceful, Inclusive, Integrated.
- `M1-15, M1-16, M1-17, M1-18`: Rockefeller Foundation framework dimensions (González Castillo et al., 2022).
- `F1-13, F1-14, F1-15, F1-16`: Brito et al. (2026) 4-dimension typology: Organizational, Spatial, Functional, Physical.
- `P1-05` to `P1-07`: CBI material triads (Coping/Adaptive/Transformative).
- `P1-08, P1-09`: Asset/Process local dimension statements.

## Integration Notes (2026-04-08)

1. **Batch M1 Verification:** The run successfully restricted itself to the three methodological sources. No substitution reported.
2. **Batch F1 Verification:** Successful extraction from the three targeted urban resilience framework sources. 18 rows extracted.
3. **Dimension Discipline:** M1 and F1 rows with explicit "output" or "asset" wording were integrated and used to strengthen provisional dimension assignments. F1-07, F1-08, F1-09 (WGS) use "output KPIs" explicitly.
4. **Register Expansion:** F1 added significant depth to "Infrastructure", "Governance transparency", and "Risk assessment" clusters.
5. **Supersession:** Pilot P2 (methodological) is now effectively superseded by M1. Pilot P3 (frameworks) is now superseded by F1.
