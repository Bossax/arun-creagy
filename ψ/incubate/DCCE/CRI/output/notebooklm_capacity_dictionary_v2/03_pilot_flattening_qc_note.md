# Pilot flattening and QC note — NotebookLM capacity dictionary v2

This note records the local flattening of the raw NotebookLM pilot responses and the first QC review against the pilot gates in [`00_query_plan.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/notebooklm_capacity_dictionary_v2/00_query_plan.md).

## Scope and flattening method

- Raw inputs reviewed:
  - [`responses/2026-04-08_pilot_pass1_local_raw_rows.json`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/notebooklm_capacity_dictionary_v2/responses/2026-04-08_pilot_pass1_local_raw_rows.json)
  - [`responses/2026-04-08_pilot_pass2_methodological_notebooklm_raw.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/notebooklm_capacity_dictionary_v2/responses/2026-04-08_pilot_pass2_methodological_notebooklm_raw.md)
  - [`responses/2026-04-08_pilot_pass3_frameworks_notebooklm_raw.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/notebooklm_capacity_dictionary_v2/responses/2026-04-08_pilot_pass3_frameworks_notebooklm_raw.md)
- Local flattening action:
  1. kept the leading JSON arrays as the row-level evidence payloads;
  2. treated the trailing NotebookLM extraction-note and reference-list text as run-level metadata, not row records;
  3. assigned local row IDs `P2-01` to `P2-12` and `P3-01` to `P3-12` for harmonisation and QC;
  4. used `P1-01` to `P1-13` as shorthand for the existing Pass 1 JSON row order.

## Run-level caveats carried forward into local synthesis

- Both NotebookLM pilot files were already close to the preferred flat schema, so flattening was light-touch rather than a major rewrite.
- Both runs appended markdown text after the JSON array; that wrapper text was preserved in the raw files but excluded from the row inventory below.
- Pass 2 explicitly states that the three requested methodological pilot sources were not present in the uploaded notebook literature and that substitute thematic sources were used instead.
- Pass 3 explicitly states that the requested framework source names were not literal matches to the uploaded notebook literature and that substitute thematic sources were used instead.
- These source-availability notes do not invalidate the saved raw rows, but they do limit the pilot as a scale-up signal because the evidence does not come from the exact intended pilot source packet.

## Pilot QC against the plan gates

| QC gate from [`00_query_plan.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/output/notebooklm_capacity_dictionary_v2/00_query_plan.md) | Outcome | Local assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Citation coverage | Pass with caveat | Every Pass 2 and Pass 3 row has a usable citation. Most citations are abstract / annex / exhibit / table / section level rather than page-precise, but they remain usable for local review. |
| Row structure consistency | Pass | Both NotebookLM outputs returned a flat JSON array with the expected fields. The extra markdown note and reference list occurred after the array and were easy to separate locally. |
| Low drift into synthesis | Pass with caution | The responses did not de-duplicate, harmonise into a canonical taxonomy, or rewrite the local register. However, a few fields show mild noise or over-assignment, especially `P3-01` and `P3-03`, so source-near review remains necessary. |
| Manageable local harmonisation effort | Pass | Cleanup burden was low. Local work mainly involved assigning row IDs, ignoring the post-array wrapper text, and clustering obvious overlaps. |
| Boundary compliance | Pass | The workflow remained local for harmonisation/QC, and the raw responses were saved verbatim. No repo-local file was treated as notebook-accessible. |

## Additional scale-up hold point

Formal pilot QC gates were mostly satisfied in shape, but scale-up should still be held for one reason:

- **source-packet fidelity is not yet secure.** Both NotebookLM runs report that the requested pilot source names were missing or not literal matches, and they substituted other uploaded literature. That means the pilot validated the extraction format more than it validated the exact planned source packet.

## Recommendation

Do **not** proceed to full-scale extraction yet.

Before scaling, tighten one of the following:

1. align the pilot prompts with the exact uploaded NotebookLM source titles actually present in the notebook; or
2. adjust the instructions so NotebookLM must fail fast when the requested sources are unavailable, rather than silently substituting nearby literature.

After that adjustment, rerun the pilot passes or at minimum rerun the affected pass before using the pilot as a scale-up green light.
