# CRI Evidence Registry

This registry records the **evidence backbone for the Climate Risk Index (CRI)** project. It follows the evidence registry pattern established in the CRDB project, but is scoped specifically to **DCCE / CRI** under `ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRI/`.

Each row links a concrete artifact (source, note, synthesis, or output) to its role in CRI Phase 1 and Phase 2 design and implementation. Over time, this table should become the **single authoritative map** of which evidence backs which methodology sections, design decisions, and implementation choices.

> [!note]
> - **id** should be a stable identifier (`E-CRI-###`) used in methodology notes, the coverage map, and decision logs.
> - **path** is always recorded relative to the repo root (`c:/Users/sitth/OracleWorkspace/Arun_Creagy`).
> - **type** distinguishes raw sources, internal notes, curated outputs, and AI-assisted syntheses.
> - **dimensions** should reference CRI-relevant concepts such as `impact`, `capacity`, `data_richness`, `SES`, `governance`, etc.
