# CRDB Change Log

## Purpose

This ledger records **human-readable summaries of major direction shifts** in the CRDB project: what changed, why, and what it affected. It complements the more granular trigger, decision, and submission ledgers.

It is designed to answer, in plain language:

- what changed,
- why it changed,
- who or what triggered it, and
- which artifacts and stances were affected.

## Usage and maintenance

- Add an entry when the **project direction, governance stance, or key deliverable trajectory** changes.
- Each entry should reference:
  - trigger(s) from [`CRDB-Trigger-Log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/CRDB-Trigger-Log.md)
  - decisions from [`phase1_decision_log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/phase1_decision_log.md)
  - deliverables from [`CRDB-Deliverable-Map.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/CRDB-Deliverable-Map.md)
- Use **append-only** updates; do not delete historical change notes.
 - When reconstructing history, treat the neutral staging timeline as the chronological entry point: [`CRDB-Project-History-Timeline.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/CRDB-Project-History-Timeline.md)

## Change log

| Change ID | Date | Change summary | Trigger(s) | Affected decisions | Affected deliverables | Impact description | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CH-001 | 2026-03-24 | Locked Phase 1 stance around catalog-first architecture, workflow-pattern-first sitemap, and MVP-3 + MVP-2 as the core deliverables; clarified governance gates and endorsement approach. | T-001 | Phase 1 decisions as recorded in [`phase1_decision_log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/phase1_decision_log.md) | D-001 (management evidence pack), D-002 (interim report narrative), future governance notes (D-004) | Consolidated previous assumptions into a confirmed decision set, tightening scope and expectations for interim report drafting and governance design. | Acts as the main reference for "what changed at the March 24 progress meeting"; later changes should reference this entry when revisiting decisions. |
| CH-002 | 2026-03-27 | Created the first CRDB project-management anchors: trigger log, deliverable map, claim register, submission log, change log, project-management module specs, and a controlled facade contract. | T-001, T-002, T-003 | None new; these artifacts operationalize existing decisions without changing them. | D-003 (this deliverable map), D-005 (submission log), project-management module and facade specs | Shifted project-management practice from ad-hoc reasoning to explicit, artifact-centered ledgers, while preserving a low-agency, advisory posture for any automation. | This change introduces the scaffolding for Option B (controlled facade) without enabling autonomous orchestration. |

| CH-003 | 2026-01-05 | Established early Phase 1 framing anchors: NCAIF as the organizing “front door” and CDM as the interoperability backbone (basis for later catalog-first stance). | T-008, T-009 | Later confirmed architecture stance in [`phase1_decision_log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/phase1_decision_log.md) | D-009 (NCAIF), D-010 (CDM), D-013 (decision log) | Created the conceptual scaffolding needed for later “catalog-first/link-first” decisions and for treating the website as a presentation layer over a governed semantic model. | This is a framing establishment (not a later pivot), but it is a major historical hinge: later changes should be read as refinements to this backbone, not replacements. |

| CH-004 | 2026-03-09 | Reframed MVP language and scope: workflow patterns vs MVPs clarified; MVP-2 repositioned as DDPM→DCCE ingestion **groundwork** tied to Loss & Damage MVD/logical model, not an automated pipeline. | T-014 | MVP priority and pipeline-scope constraints in [`phase1_decision_log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/phase1_decision_log.md) | D-013 (decision log), D-014 (drafting baseline package) | Reduced scope creep risk by making “MVP” mean a deliverable entity, while allowing workflow patterns to remain a navigational tool; made MVP-2 feasible as Phase 1 groundwork. | This change is a semantic + scope stabilization that later sponsor conversations can reuse when clarifying what is and is not being built. |

| CH-005 | 2026-03-18 | Introduced a deadline-driven freeze boundary for the interim report submission cycle (“ship as-is” cutoff), establishing a clear internal milestone before external snapshots. | T-013 | Interim report drafting baseline constraints referenced in [`phase1_decision_log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/phase1_decision_log.md) | D-014 (drafting baseline package), D-002 (interim report snapshots) | Made the submission cycle auditable: later content gaps can be explained as deliberately deferred beyond the cutoff, not forgotten. | See S-003 in [`CRDB-Submission-Log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/CRDB-Submission-Log.md). |

| CH-006 | 2026-03-27 | Sponsor progress meeting confirmed multiple practical pivots: strict TOR alignment for interim-report revision; “CDM mental model” required to avoid a static website; Phase 1 MVP focus narrowed to L&D structure + data catalog; workshop logistics became urgent (invite letters early next month); and coordination with Digital Tech consultant initiative became a dependency. | T-004, T-002 | Reinforces (not replaces) Phase 1 stance in [`phase1_decision_log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/phase1_decision_log.md); introduces coordination requirements for governance ownership mapping | D-002 (interim report snapshots), D-006 (workshop package), D-004 (governance role-mapping notes), D-009 (NCAIF), D-010 (CDM) | Converted several “good practice” ideas into sponsor-backed requirements and critical-path tasks; increased urgency for logistics and cross-team alignment to avoid duplicated platform work. | Evidence anchor: E-021 (meeting summary), plus E-024/E-023 for coordination context. |

| CH-007 | 2026-03-27 | Workshop stream reframed as a bridge/baton-pass from earlier baseline meetings to NFCS validation: shift from dataset identification toward synthesis via facilitated breakouts, aligned to sponsor constraints. | T-005, T-004 | Workshop positioning consistent with Phase 1 stance in [`phase1_decision_log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/phase1_decision_log.md) | D-017 (workshop stream continuation plan), D-006 (workshop invite + logistics package) | Protects participant time and reduces repetition by making the April workshop produce missing synthesis outputs rather than redoing baseline inventorying. | This change should be treated as a facilitation design constraint and a narrative device for stakeholder communications. |

## Practical reading order

1. Review this file to understand **major phases and turning points**.
2. For each row:
   - inspect underlying triggers → [`CRDB-Trigger-Log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/CRDB-Trigger-Log.md)
   - confirm decision details → [`phase1_decision_log.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/phase1_decision_log.md)
   - assess deliverable impact → [`CRDB-Deliverable-Map.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/CRDB-Deliverable-Map.md)
