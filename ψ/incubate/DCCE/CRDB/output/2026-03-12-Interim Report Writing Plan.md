# Interim Report Writing Plan — CRDB (TOR 7.2)

supersede [[CRDB interim report]]
## Objective
Deliver the interim report by **23 Mar 10:00** (billing constraint), aligned to TOR 7.2 and the post‑FGD2 synthesis requirements, **with a progress‑first narrative that updates sponsor understanding from TOR‑era assumptions to current evidence and decisions**.

## Storytelling strategy (progress‑first)

**Goal:** evolve sponsor understanding from **TOR assumptions → current evidence → architectural interpretation → validated Phase 1 direction**, so conclusions are earned rather than abrupt.

1) **Start from the TOR intent** (what the sponsor asked for at contract start).
2) **Show what changed and why** (evidence, constraints, FGD1/FGD2 signals, Pack A realities, current DCCE website limitations, Pack C UX guidance).
3) **Explain the hidden logic**: show why **CDM** is needed as the back-end organizing logic and management structure, not as a detached technical artifact.
4) **Then land on visible Phase 1 expressions**: show how **workflow patterns and MVPs** translate that logic into user-facing services, while making clear what is real now, what is groundwork, and what remains future-facing.

## Section 1 positioning logic: CDM and MVPs

- **CDM** should be positioned in the interim report as the **hidden organizing logic** that explains why DCCE cannot move directly from scattered assets to a usable national adaptation information service. It is the conceptual layer that connects content types, data relationships, governance roles, and publishing rules behind the interface.
- **MVPs** should be positioned as **visible Phase 1 service expressions** of workflow patterns, not as the whole story and not yet as final-report-scale product claims.
- In other words: **CDM explains why the structure must change; MVPs show how the revised structure becomes useful in practice.**
- The interim report should therefore treat CDM and MVPs as **evidence-backed explanatory devices for project progress**, not as abrupt action-oriented conclusions.

## Section 1 methodology logic: how we got here

- The Section 1 story must explicitly explain **how sponsor understanding evolved** from TOR intent to current NCAIF architecture.
- The methodology sequence is:
  1. **Interview and workshop evidence** → derive user demand, pain points, workflow needs, and publishing constraints.
  2. **Benchmark and literature review** → derive why a conceptual data blueprint is necessary, and why standards alignment matters.
  3. **Three-platform review + T-PLAT lessons** → revisit the inception-report benchmark set, then focus on T-PLAT as the nearest predecessor and summarize what it got right, what it could not do, and why NCAIF must move beyond a static portal model.
  4. **Current DCCE website and risk-map review** → establish the evidence base of current assets and product reality; detailed landscape description can sit in Section 2, while Section 1 retains only the analytical implications needed for the architecture argument.
  5. **Synthesis into CDM + NCAIF + workflow patterns/MVPs** → turn evidence into a bounded Phase 1 architecture.

## Section 1 evidence map (subsection-by-subsection)

| Subsection | Core claim to establish | Main evidence | How CDM should be positioned | How MVPs should be positioned |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1.1 TOR intent recap** | The sponsor originally asked for a national adaptation information framework plus management structure, not merely a website facelift | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/CRDB - TOR.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/CRDB%20-%20TOR.md) | CDM is introduced as the kind of conceptual management logic implicitly required by TOR 5.2.3 | MVPs are not yet the focus; they appear later as practical Phase 1 expressions |
| **1.2 User-demand derivation** | NCAIF structure and MVP choices come from observed stakeholder demand, not arbitrary design taste | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/NCAIF_Use_Cases.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/NCAIF_Use_Cases.md) and interview-derived artifacts in the same project space | CDM is justified as the shared conceptual structure needed to serve recurring use cases, data pain points, boundary confusion, and governance constraints | MVPs are derived from recurring workflow needs seen in interviews and focus groups |
| **1.3 Why a conceptual data blueprint is needed** | The project needed a business-facing data blueprint before any logical or physical build because TOR asks for management structure, inventories, and future dataset design | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/Conceptual Data Model for climate risk and adaptation data system.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/Conceptual%20Data%20Model%20for%20climate%20risk%20and%20adaptation%20data%20system.md), [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/What is Conceptual Data Modeling Purpose & Examples.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/What%20is%20Conceptual%20Data%20Modeling%20Purpose%20%26%20Examples.md), and [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/Conceptual vs Logical vs Physical Data Models.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/Conceptual%20vs%20Logical%20vs%20Physical%20Data%20Models.md) | CDM is framed as the translation layer between business requirements and future system implementation | MVPs remain downstream products that depend on this shared blueprint |
| **1.4 Standards and literature alignment** | CDM entity names and relationships were not invented ad hoc; they were aligned to IPCC, WMO, UNFCCC, and ISO logic | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_note/Technical Interoperability and Data Modeling in Disaster Risk Reduction - A Comparative Analysis of IPCC, Sendai, and Global Standards.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_note/Technical%20Interoperability%20and%20Data%20Modeling%20in%20Disaster%20Risk%20Reduction%20-%20A%20Comparative%20Analysis%20of%20IPCC,%20Sendai,%20and%20Global%20Standards.md), [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/National Climate Adaptation Information Framework.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/National%20Climate%20Adaptation%20Information%20Framework.md), and supporting data-model notes in project inbox_source | CDM is positioned as standards-aligned conceptual infrastructure, especially for hazard, exposure, vulnerability, event, attribution, and adaptation-cycle logic | MVPs inherit standards discipline indirectly through the CDM and publishing rules |
| **1.5 Predecessor review: three-platform benchmark + T-PLAT lessons** | Section 1.5 should revisit the three climate adaptation platforms reviewed in the inception report while focusing on T-PLAT as the nearest predecessor and summarizing its lessons for the current draft | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/260106_DCCE_Climate risk database_inception report_vfinal.pdf`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/260106_DCCE_Climate%20risk%20database_inception%20report_vfinal.pdf), [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/T-PLAT analysis.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/T-PLAT%20analysis.md), [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/Learnings from T-PLAT - Benchmarking CDM.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/Learnings%20from%20T-PLAT%20-%20Benchmarking%20CDM.md), and [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-13-Three-Platform Review and T-PLAT Lessons.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-13-Three-Platform%20Review%20and%20T-PLAT%20Lessons.md) | CDM is only foreshadowed here as the structural step beyond portal-first precedent; the subsection stays primarily on benchmark and predecessor lessons | MVP implications stay light here; visible service lessons from T-PLAT are carried forward to later sections |
| **1.6 Current-state implications from the current website and product landscape** | Section 1.6 should retain only the analytical implications drawn from the DCCE website review and the spatial risk-map product review: the current landscape contains real assets, but they remain fragmented, bounded, and insufficient as a coherent national service without reorganization | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12-DCCE_Website_Content_Gap_Summary.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12-DCCE_Website_Content_Gap_Summary.md), [`ψ/inbox/2026-03-12 - รายงานฐานข้อมูลความเสี่ยงเชิงพื้นที่จากการเปลี่ยนแปลงสภาพภูมิอากาศไทยฉบับสมบูรณ์  -notebooklm extraction.md`](ψ/inbox/2026-03-12%20-%20รายงานฐานข้อมูลความเสี่ยงเชิงพื้นที่จากการเปลี่ยนแปลงสภาพภูมิอากาศไทยฉบับสมบูรณ์%20%20-notebooklm%20extraction.md), and the v2 working draft in [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-13-CRDB-Interim-Report-Section-1.6-1.12-Draft-th-v2.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-13-CRDB-Interim-Report-Section-1.6-1.12-Draft-th-v2.md) | CDM is not argued in full here; this subsection now establishes only the analytical problem that later architectural sections must resolve | MVP discussion stays deferred; descriptive landscape material is expected to be developed later in Chapter 2 |
| **1.7 UX and IA diagnosis** | Usability requires strong information scent, shallow navigation, matrix pathways, progressive disclosure, and separation of tools from catalogs | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/2026-03-12 - User Experience Design Principles for National Climate Change Adaptation Information Services.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/2026-03-12%20-%20User%20Experience%20Design%20Principles%20for%20National%20Climate%20Change%20Adaptation%20Information%20Services.md), especially its arguments on information scent, matrix taxonomy, and decoupled architecture | CDM is not a screen; it is the structural logic that allows separated front-end experiences to remain connected | MVPs are the visible pathways that embody these principles for policy users, local implementers, and technical analysts |
| **1.8 Architectural interpretation** | The project therefore needs a hidden organizing layer between fragmented content and user-facing services | Current NCAIF structure in [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/National Climate Adaptation Information Framework.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/National%20Climate%20Adaptation%20Information%20Framework.md), plus Pack A and Pack C evidence, synthesized in [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12_crdb-section1-cdm-mvp-evidence-analysis.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12_crdb-section1-cdm-mvp-evidence-analysis.md) | CDM becomes the explanation for why NCAIF can connect products, data, methods, and governance without collapsing into one menu tree | MVPs become service wrappers placed on top of the information structure, not substitutes for the architecture |
| **1.9 Service translation** | Phase 1 must show a small number of usable service expressions rather than promise full system completion | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/NCAIF — Workflow patterns + MVP v3.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/NCAIF%20%E2%80%94%20Workflow%20patterns%20%2B%20MVP%20v3.md), [`ψ/memory/logs/info/2026-03-09_20-18_mvp-vs-workflow-patterns-and-mvp2-groundwork.md`](ψ/memory/logs/info/2026-03-09_20-18_mvp-vs-workflow-patterns-and-mvp2-groundwork.md), and [`ψ/memory/logs/info/2026-03-11_16-59_fgd2-sitemap-focus-platform-framing.md`](ψ/memory/logs/info/2026-03-11_16-59_fgd2-sitemap-focus-platform-framing.md) | CDM remains central as the logic underneath all service pathways | MVPs are the limited, credible, Phase 1-visible expressions of that logic |
| **1.10 Consultation and revision loop** | FGD1 and FGD2 shifted sponsor understanding from website-centric expectations toward architecture, workflow, and governance awareness | [`ψ/memory/logs/info/2026-03-11_16-59_fgd2-sitemap-focus-platform-framing.md`](ψ/memory/logs/info/2026-03-11_16-59_fgd2-sitemap-focus-platform-framing.md), [`ψ/memory/logs/info/2026-03-11_17-12_fgd2-sitemap-needs-more-detail-and-remains-flexible.md`](ψ/memory/logs/info/2026-03-11_17-12_fgd2-sitemap-needs-more-detail-and-remains-flexible.md), [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/2026-03-11_FGD2_action_summary.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/2026-03-11_FGD2_action_summary.md) | CDM is what decision-makers learned sits behind the sitemap and makes change manageable | MVPs are what make the sitemap feel practical and explainable to decision-makers |
| **1.11 Current Phase 1 position** | The refined NCAIF structure is now a bounded, evidence-backed Phase 1 architecture | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/National Climate Adaptation Information Framework.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/National%20Climate%20Adaptation%20Information%20Framework.md), [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12 - NCAIF_Pack_ABC_Decision_Matrix.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12%20-%20NCAIF_Pack_ABC_Decision_Matrix.md) | CDM is the hidden architecture that keeps this bounded structure coherent and extensible | MVPs identify what Phase 1 visibly supports now, what stays documentation-light, and what remains groundwork |

### Section 1 evidence synthesis notes

- The **interview and use-case evidence** shows how user demand and preferences were actually derived: through stakeholder interviews, workshop signals, and internal focus-group feedback about usability, pain points, data discovery, publishing constraints, resolution needs, and decision-support requirements. This is the empirical basis for both NCAIF IA and MVP derivation.
- The **conceptual-modeling and standards evidence** shows why the project needed a CDM in the first place: TOR asks for management structure, baseline categorization, and future dataset design, while literature and standards explain that a conceptual model is the bridge from business requirements to implementation.
- The **three-platform benchmark review plus T-PLAT lesson summary** explains the predecessor logic and its limits. NCAIF does not start from zero; it inherits lessons from the inception-report benchmark set and especially from T-PLAT, but must move beyond a static portal and document library toward a more relational and service-oriented architecture.
- The **website gap evidence** should be framed briefly and concretely: NCAIF is to be hosted inside the DCCE website, not positioned as a replacement for it, and the scattered existing content should be treated as foundational material to reorganize, connect, and upgrade.
- The **risk-map report evidence** should remain factual in its own subsection: DCCE already has one substantial product domain, but it is bounded in scale, interpretation, and suitable uses. Applications to CDM, NCAIF, and MVP design should be interpreted later rather than folded into the product-reality subsection itself.
- The **UX benchmark evidence** shows that the front-end must separate catalogs from tools, use shallow and narrative pathways, and maintain progressive disclosure and information scent. This provides the rationale for why NCAIF cannot simply mirror DCCE's bureaucratic site structure or expose raw backend complexity directly.
- The consolidated read across these method streams is captured in [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12_crdb-section1-cdm-mvp-evidence-analysis.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12_crdb-section1-cdm-mvp-evidence-analysis.md).
- Therefore, **Section 1 should argue that CDM is the hidden logic that reconciles fragmented content, product reality, and usable interface design, while MVPs are the limited Phase 1 expressions through which this logic becomes visible to users.**

## Section 2 positioning logic: current data product landscape and interview synthesis

- For the **interim report**, Section 2 should be narrower than a full baseline-inventory chapter.
- Its main role is to explain the **current data product landscape** and synthesize interview findings around four practical questions:
  1. what data products and systems already exist,
  2. what data stakeholders generate or manage,
  3. how they collect and update those data,
  4. what datasets they still need and what use cases they are trying to support.
- Section 2 should therefore function as a **landscape review + interview synthesis**, not as a completed national inventory chapter.
- To preserve the line of logic in Section 1, the more descriptive current-state material from Chapter 1 sections **1.6** and **1.7** may be relocated into Section 2, while Section 1 retains only the analytical results that are necessary for the architecture argument.
- In effect:
  - **Section 1** = why the structure had to change and what the architecture means
  - **Section 2** = what current products, data practices, unmet needs, and use cases that architecture must respond to

## Section 2 evidence map (subsection-by-subsection)

| Subsection | Core claim to establish | Main evidence | Link to Chapter 1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2.1 TOR intent recap** | TOR 5.3.1-5.3.2 requires a review of the current product and data landscape, not merely a technical list | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/CRDB - TOR.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/inbox_source/CRDB%20-%20TOR.md), [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/CRDB - Implementation Plan.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/CRDB%20-%20Implementation%20Plan.md) | Keeps Section 2 grounded in TOR rather than repeating Section 1 architecture logic |
| **2.2 Current data product landscape** | DCCE and partner agencies already have multiple products, portals, dashboards, reports, and systems, but they are fragmented | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter2-current-data-product-landscape-table.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter2-current-data-product-landscape-table.md), [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/FGD 1 result.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/FGD%201%20result.md), [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12-DCCE_Website_Content_Gap_Summary.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12-DCCE_Website_Content_Gap_Summary.md), and Pack A evidence in [`ψ/inbox/2026-03-12 - รายงานฐานข้อมูลความเสี่ยงเชิงพื้นที่จากการเปลี่ยนแปลงสภาพภูมิอากาศไทยฉบับสมบูรณ์  -notebooklm extraction.md`](ψ/inbox/2026-03-12%20-%20รายงานฐานข้อมูลความเสี่ยงเชิงพื้นที่จากการเปลี่ยนแปลงสภาพภูมิอากาศไทยฉบับสมบูรณ์%20%20-notebooklm%20extraction.md) | Absorbs the descriptive current-state material that would otherwise overload Section 1.6-1.7 |
| **2.3 Stakeholder-generated data and collection practice** | Agencies generate or manage different kinds of data through different mechanisms such as surveys, reporting chains, registries, modeling, and external data integration | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter2-interview-comparison-matrix.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter2-interview-comparison-matrix.md) plus supporting interview summaries in [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/Interview summary notes`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/Interview%20summary%20notes) | Extends Section 1.2 interview evidence into operational data practice rather than design criteria |
| **2.4 Update frequency, scale, and operational constraints** | Data usefulness depends on update cadence, spatial granularity, quality controls, and access constraints | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter2-interview-comparison-matrix.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter2-interview-comparison-matrix.md), with operational detail anchored in DDPM, NSO, MSDHS, OTP, DLA, DGA, TBA, and NESDC interview summaries | Prevents Section 1 from carrying too much descriptive operational detail |
| **2.5 Expressed dataset needs** | Stakeholders consistently report unmet needs around projections, baselines, metadata, granularity, economic loss data, vulnerability data, and safe access pathways | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter2-stakeholder-needs-synthesis.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter2-stakeholder-needs-synthesis.md), [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter2-interview-comparison-matrix.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter2-interview-comparison-matrix.md), and [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/NCAIF_Use_Cases.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/NCAIF_Use_Cases.md) | Supplies the concrete demand-side evidence that later supports prioritization, without repeating Section 1 MVP framing |
| **2.6 Use cases of climate risk and impact information** | Climate risk and impact information is used across emergency response, local planning, budgeting, social protection, macroeconomic planning, infrastructure resilience, and financial risk analysis | [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter2-use-case-clustering.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter2-use-case-clustering.md), [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/NCAIF_Use_Cases.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/NCAIF_Use_Cases.md), and the interview summaries in [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/Interview summary notes`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/Interview%20summary%20notes) | Connects the product landscape to why the architecture matters, without replacing Section 1.10 |
| **2.7 Synthesis and progress implications** | The current landscape shows both existing assets and major coordination gaps; the project's immediate value lies in organizing and clarifying this landscape | the full evidence package above, especially [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter1-to-Chapter2-handoff-analysis.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-17-Chapter1-to-Chapter2-handoff-analysis.md), plus [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/CRDB - Project Status (Current).md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/CRDB%20-%20Project%20Status%20(Current).md) | Hands the argument back to later report sections while avoiding a second architecture chapter |

## Pre-drafting analysis tasks for Section 2 (not report content)

These should be completed **before** drafting Section 2 and should **not** appear as a subsection in the report:

1. Interview comparison matrix
   - agency, role, products/systems, data generated or managed, collection method, update frequency, scale, expressed needs, use cases
2. Current data product landscape table
   - visible systems, owners, purpose, audience, and current status
3. Stakeholder-needs synthesis note
   - grouped by projections, baselines, metadata, granularity, economic loss, vulnerability, and access/publishing constraints
4. Use-case clustering note
   - grouped by emergency response, local planning and budgeting, social protection, macroeconomic planning, infrastructure resilience, and financial risk analysis
5. Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 handoff note
   - what descriptive material moves to Section 2 and what analytical conclusions remain in Section 1

## Section 2 source-to-artifact mapping and reuse rules

This mapping should remain embedded in the anchor writing plan rather than split into a separate note.

### Reuse rules

1. **Descriptive current-state material** belongs in the Section 2 analysis artifacts and later Chapter 2 prose.
2. **Architectural interpretation** remains in Chapter 1, except where a short bridge sentence is needed.
3. When evidence is uneven, record it as `explicit`, `implied`, or `not yet specified` rather than forcing false precision.
4. The current data product landscape must combine:
   - DCCE website-content findings from [`ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12-DCCE_Website_Content_Gap_Summary.md`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12-DCCE_Website_Content_Gap_Summary.md)
   - Pack A risk-map product evidence from [`ψ/inbox/2026-03-12 - รายงานฐานข้อมูลความเสี่ยงเชิงพื้นที่จากการเปลี่ยนแปลงสภาพภูมิอากาศไทยฉบับสมบูรณ์  -notebooklm extraction.md`](ψ/inbox/2026-03-12%20-%20รายงานฐานข้อมูลความเสี่ยงเชิงพื้นที่จากการเปลี่ยนแปลงสภาพภูมิอากาศไทยฉบับสมบูรณ์%20%20-notebooklm%20extraction.md)

## Required TOR coverage (Interim Report)

1. **Results of TOR 5.2.1–5.2.5** (Draft NCAIF + management structure progress)
2. **Results of TOR 5.3.1–5.3.2** (baseline data + product landscape assessment)
3. **Progress on TOR 5.5.1–5.5.2** (knowledge set review + significant study shortlist)

## Section outline + evidence map

### Section 0 — Executive Summary (2–3 pages)
- **Sponsor‑orientation**: what the TOR expected vs what evidence now shows
- What changed since inception report (why the understanding evolved)
- FGD2 validation highlights (confirming or revising assumptions)
- Pack A integration: risk‑map product reality + limitations (boundary of Phase‑1 claims)
- Why the project now distinguishes **interface value** (NCAIF), **hidden organizing logic** (CDM), and **Phase 1 service expressions** (workflow patterns + MVPs)

### Section 1 — NCAIF development, management structure, and sitemap refinement (TOR 5.2)
- **1.1 TOR intent recap**: what “NCAIF + management structure” was expected to deliver at project start
- **1.2 Methodology: deriving user demand and design criteria** from stakeholder interviews, workshop evidence, and internal focus-group findings
- **1.3 Methodology: why the project needed a CDM** based on conceptual-modeling logic, TOR requirements, and literature on risk-data architecture
- **1.4 Methodology: standards and benchmark alignment** using IPCC, WMO, UNFCCC, ISO, and related literature to shape the entity logic and adaptation-cycle structure
- **1.5 Predecessor review**: review the three climate adaptation platforms from the inception report, while focusing on T-PLAT and summarizing lessons from T-PLAT for the current draft
- **1.6 Current-state implications from the website and product landscape**: merge the analytical results of the DCCE website review and the spatial risk-map review, while moving fuller descriptive landscape material to Section 2
- **1.7 UX/IA diagnosis**: Pack C principles → why the presentation layer must separate tools, catalogs, explainers, and guided pathways
- **1.8 Architectural interpretation**: CDM as the hidden logic and management structure that reconciles fragmented content, product types, metadata, governance, and cross-linking
- **1.9 Service translation**: workflow patterns + MVPs as the visible Phase 1 expressions of that logic, showing how users actually encounter value without over-claiming full platform buildout
- **1.10 Locked design choices and navigation model**: explain the stable backbone, flexible elements, policy-maker-centered access model, and the separation between narrative surface and technical support layer using the latest locked NCAIF decisions
- **1.11 Current Phase 1 position**: refined NCAIF structure and boundary statements (supported by Pack A/B/C evidence and explicit scope control)

- **TOR intent recap**: expected baseline inventory outputs
- **2.1 TOR intent and purpose of the landscape review**
- **2.2 Current data product landscape**: what products, systems, dashboards, reports, and portals already exist across DCCE and partner agencies
- **2.3 Stakeholder-generated data and collection/update practice**: what data agencies generate or manage, how they collect it, and how often they update it
- **2.4 Operational constraints of current data**: scale, cadence, quality, access, and governance limitations affecting usability
- **2.5 Expressed dataset needs**: what stakeholders still need in usable form
- **2.6 Use cases of climate risk and impact information**: what agencies are trying to do with these data in practice
- **2.7 Synthesis and progress implications**: what the landscape review implies for the interim report and next drafting stages

### Section 3 — Knowledge Sets (TOR 5.5 progress)
- **Main message**: เสนอแนวคิดว่า ผลผลิตตาม TOR 5.5 (ชุดองค์ความรู้ + สื่อสรุป) สามารถถูก "จัดรูป" ให้กลายเป็น **minimum content layer** สำหรับเว็บไซต์ NCAIF ระยะที่ 1 ได้ แทนที่จะเป็นเพียงงานสื่อสารแยกส่วน
- **TOR intent recap (as‑is)**: ทบทวนขอบเขตดั้งเดิมของ Task 5.5 ตาม TOR 5.5 (ทบทวนงานศึกษาย้อนหลัง 10 ปีใน 6 ภาคส่วน NAP เลือกอย่างน้อย 10 งานศึกษา พัฒนาอินโฟกราฟิก บทความ และชุดโรลอัป) แล้วชี้ให้เห็นว่าขอบเขตดังกล่าวเปิดพื้นที่ให้ "จัดเรียงใหม่" เป็นชั้นเนื้อหา NCAIF ได้อย่างไร
- อธิบาย Task 5.5 ในฐานะ **แนวคิดกึ่งสำเร็จรูป** ที่กำลังทดลองใช้ TOR 5.5 เป็นกรอบในการออกแบบ minimum content ของ NCAIF: เริ่มจาก evidence review matrix → shortlist บทความ → media package ที่สามารถนำไปวางบนเพจ NCAIF ได้โดยตรงในระยะแรก
- รายงานเพียง **สถานะความก้าวหน้าเชิงหลักการ** ว่าการจัดรูปขอบเขต TOR 5.5 ให้เป็น minimum NCAIF content เดินหน้าไปถึงไหนแล้ว และส่วนใดที่ยังเป็นคำถามเปิด (เช่น จำนวน/ความลึกของบทความที่ทำได้จริงก่อนเส้นตาย)
- เชื่อมโยง Task 5.5 กับ NCAIF แบบตรงไปตรงมา: ชุดองค์ความรู้ถูกวางให้เป็น "ชั้นเนื้อหาเริ่มต้น" ของหน้า NCAIF หลัก ๆ (climate foundations, sector risk & adaptation, risk‑map explainers, decision‑maker briefs) โดยยอมรับว่ารายละเอียด mapping ยังอยู่ระหว่างร่าง
- ย้ำ **guardrails เดิมของ Task 5.5** จากบันทึกขอบเขตงาน: งานนี้คือการใช้ TOR 5.5 เพื่อสร้างชั้นเนื้อหา NCAIF ขั้นต่ำ ไม่ใช่งานสร้างระบบข้อมูลใหม่ ไม่ใช่การพัฒนาแบบจำลองความเสี่ยงใหม่ และไม่ใช่การเปิด API ผลิตระดับ production

#### โครงร่างบทที่ 3 (ฉบับภาษาไทย — รายงานความก้าวหน้า)

1. **บทนำ: ใช้ TOR 5.5 เพื่อออกแบบ minimum content ของ NCAIF**  
   1.1 เล่าขอบเขต Task 5.5 ตามที่ระบุใน TOR 5.5.1–5.5.2 และบันทึกขอบเขตงาน Task 5.5 Scope แบบตรงไปตรงมา โดยยอมรับว่าบางส่วนยังอยู่ในระดับ “แนวคิด”  
   1.2 เสนอกรอบคิดหลักของบทนี้อย่างชัดเจนว่า **เรากำลังทดลองใช้ผลผลิต TOR 5.5 เป็นฐานในการออกแบบชั้นเนื้อหาเริ่มต้นของเว็บไซต์ NCAIF** ไม่ใช่เพียงผลิตสื่อให้ครบจำนวนตาม TOR  
   1.3 เชื่อมโยง Task 5.5 กับโครงสร้าง NCAIF โดยเน้นว่า minimum content ที่ได้จาก TOR 5.5 จะไปเติมเต็มหน้าไหน/กลุ่มเนื้อหาไหนในภาพใหญ่ แม้ mapping รายละเอียดจะยังเป็นร่างอยู่

2. **วิธีคิด: จัดรูปผลผลิต TOR 5.5 ให้กลายเป็น minimum NCAIF content**  
   2.1 สรุปไอเดียหลักจากบันทึก Task 5.5 Scope ว่าอาจต้องมีชั้นของการทบทวนหลักฐาน (matrix), ชั้นของบทความสังเคราะห์, และชุดสื่อที่สอดคล้องกับ TOR  
   2.2 อธิบายว่าหากมองจากมุม NCAIF ขั้นต่ำ เราจะใช้ **matrix → shortlist บทความ → media** เป็นสายโซ่ที่แปลง “รายการงานศึกษา 10 ปี + ข้อกำหนดสื่อตาม TOR” ให้กลายเป็นชุดเนื้อหาที่วางบนหน้าเว็บได้จริง  
   2.3 เน้นว่าองค์ประกอบเหล่านี้ยังเป็น “ร่างโครง” ที่ใช้สำหรับคิดและคุยกับผู้ว่าจ้างในรายงานกลาง มากกว่าจะเป็นข้อกำหนดจำเพาะของทุกบทความ/อินโฟกราฟิก  
   2.4 ระบุคำถามเปิดที่ยังต้องตอบร่วมกันในช่วงครึ่งหลังของโครงการ (เช่น จะเลือกหัวข้อบทความ/สื่อแรก ๆ อย่างไรให้ครอบคลุม minimum content ของ NCAIF โดยไม่เกินทรัพยากร)

3. **สถานะความคืบหน้า: เราจัดรูป TOR 5.5 เป็น minimum NCAIF content ไปได้แค่ไหนแล้ว**  
   3.1 สิ่งที่ทำไปแล้วในระดับการเตรียมฐานข้อมูลความรู้และการคิด mapping คร่าว ๆ ระหว่างหัวข้อ TOR 5.5 กับกลุ่มหน้า NCAIF (เช่น หัวข้อที่น่าจะรองรับ climate foundations, sector risk, risk‑map explainers)  
   3.2 สิ่งที่ยังอยู่ในขั้นวางแนวคิดหรือรอหลักฐานเพิ่มเติม (เช่น การเติมเต็มรายการงานศึกษาตาม TOR ให้ครบ การดูว่าหัวข้อใดเหมาะจะเป็น minimum content ของหน้าใดก่อน)  
   3.3 ข้อจำกัดและบทเรียนเบื้องต้นจากการพยายามจะ “แปลง TOR ให้เป็น minimum content layer ของเว็บไซต์” ภายใต้ข้อจำกัดเวลาและหลักฐานที่ยังไม่ครบ

4. **ทิศทางถัดไป: จากแนวคิดไปสู่ minimum content จริงบน NCAIF**  
   4.1 สิ่งที่จะต้องทำต่อหลังรายงานกลางโครงการเพื่อให้แนวคิด “TOR 5.5 → minimum NCAIF content” กลายเป็นเนื้อหาจริง (เช่น เลือกหัวข้อ pilot 2–3 ชุด ทำต้นแบบบทความ/อินโฟกราฟิก ทดสอบผ่าน NCAIF รุ่นนำร่อง)  
   4.2 ประเด็นที่ตั้งใจ “ยังไม่ตัดสินใจ” ในรายงานฉบับนี้ เพื่อให้มีพื้นที่ทดลอง (เช่น จำนวนหัวข้อที่จะส่งมอบจริงในระยะแรก รูปแบบสื่อที่เหมาะสมที่สุดสำหรับแต่ละหน้า) และจะกลับมาเคลียร์ในรายงานฉบับสมบูรณ์  
   4.3 ย้ำ guardrails จากบันทึก Task 5.5 Scope ว่างานนี้ยังคงอยู่ในกรอบของการจัดการชุดองค์ความรู้และสื่อประกอบ ไม่ใช่งานสร้างระบบข้อมูลหรือแบบจำลองใหม่ พร้อมเน้นว่าการใช้ TOR 5.5 เป็นฐานของ minimum NCAIF content เป็นการใช้ทรัพยากรที่มีอยู่ให้เกิดคุณค่าสูงสุดในเฟสแรก

## Interim‑report inserts (appendix or stand‑alone)

1. **What FGD2 validated / changed** (1–2 pages)
2. **Sitemap vNext drill‑down + sitemap change process** (integrate Pack A caveats)
3. **Phase‑1 content gap update** (what to explain vs what already exists)
4. **Task 5.5 scope + progress snapshot**
5. **Section 1 evidence synthesis**: DCCE website gaps + Pack A product reality + Pack C UX logic, interpreted through CDM and MVP positioning

## Addendum — โครงร่างหมวดย่อยว่าด้วยการบริหารจัดการข้อมูลสำหรับ Chapter 1 (2026-03-19)

**เป้าหมายของหมวดย่อยนี้**
- ใช้เป็นหมวดย่อยปิดท้ายของ Chapter 1 ในรายงานฉบับทบทวนล่าสุด เพื่ออธิบายว่า เมื่อโครงการตีความ NCAIF และแบบจำลองข้อมูลเชิงแนวคิดเป็นโครงสร้างกลางของระบบแล้ว โครงสร้างดังกล่าวจะถูกทำให้ใช้งานได้จริงผ่าน **การบริหารจัดการข้อมูล** อย่างไร
- เนื้อหาต้องทำหน้าที่เชื่อมจากข้ออธิบายเชิงสถาปัตยกรรมใน Chapter 1 ไปสู่ข้อเสนอเชิงดำเนินงานที่จับต้องได้ โดยไม่ทำให้บทนี้กลายเป็นคู่มือปฏิบัติการเชิงเทคนิคเต็มรูปแบบ
- น้ำหนักหลักควรอยู่ที่ **แนวทางการนำไปใช้จริงในระยะที่ 1** ภายใต้บริบทของกรมการเปลี่ยนแปลงสภาพภูมิอากาศและสิ่งแวดล้อม การทำงานข้ามหน่วยงาน และการอาศัยโครงสร้างพื้นฐานภาครัฐที่มีอยู่แล้วเป็นทางหลัก

**ตำแหน่งที่เสนอ**
- เพิ่มเป็นหมวดย่อยปิดท้ายถัดจากข้อความใน Chapter 1 ปัจจุบัน โดยใช้สถานะเป็นหมวดสรุปเชิงดำเนินงานของการจัดระเบียบข้อมูลและการกำกับดูแลข้อมูล
- หากคงลำดับหมายเลขเดิม ให้พิจารณาใช้หมายเลขใหม่ต่อจากหมวดสุดท้ายของร่างล่าสุด แทนการสอดแทรกกลับไปกลางบท

### โครงร่างที่เสนอ

1. **บทนำ: เหตุใดการบริหารจัดการข้อมูลจึงเป็นเงื่อนไขของการทำให้ NCAIF ใช้งานได้จริง**  
   1.1 อธิบายว่า เมื่อข้อมูลด้านภูมิอากาศ ความเสี่ยง ผลกระทบ และการปรับตัวมาจากหลายหน่วยงาน หลายรูปแบบ และหลายระดับความพร้อมใช้ การมีเพียงแผนผังเว็บไซต์หรือกรอบข้อมูลเชิงแนวคิดยังไม่เพียงพอ หากไม่มีกติกาที่กำหนดว่าใครเป็นเจ้าของข้อมูล ใครเป็นผู้ดูแลข้อมูล ข้อมูลใดเผยแพร่ได้ในเงื่อนไขใด และต้องผ่านการตรวจสอบแบบใดก่อนเผยแพร่  
   1.2 เชื่อมให้เห็นว่า การบริหารจัดการข้อมูลในที่นี้มิได้หมายถึงการสร้างชั้นราชการเพิ่มขึ้น แต่เป็นการทำให้การเผยแพร่ข้อมูล การคัดเลือกชุดข้อมูลอ้างอิง และการเชื่อมโยงข้อมูลข้ามหน่วยงานสามารถเกิดขึ้นได้อย่างปลอดภัยและตรวจสอบย้อนกลับได้  
   1.3 ปิดย่อหน้าเปิดด้วยข้อสรุปว่า ธรรมาภิบาลข้อมูลจึงเป็นกลไกที่เปลี่ยน CDM จากโครงสร้างเชิงแนวคิดให้กลายเป็นโครงสร้างที่นำไปใช้ได้จริงในระดับสถาบัน

2. **หลักคิดของแนวทางที่เสนอ: กำกับเท่าที่จำเป็นเพื่อให้บริการระยะที่ 1 ส่งมอบได้จริง**  
   2.1 อธิบายหลักคิด **feature-driven governance** ว่า โครงการไม่ได้เริ่มจากการออกแบบระเบียบทั้งหมดขององค์กรใหม่ แต่เริ่มจากการกำหนดกติกาขั้นต่ำที่จำเป็นต่อการส่งมอบบริการสำคัญในระยะที่ 1  
   2.2 อธิบายเพิ่มเติมว่า แนวทางนี้ช่วยควบคุมขอบเขตงาน เพราะกำกับเฉพาะสิ่งที่จำเป็นต่อการคัดเลือกชุดข้อมูลอ้างอิง การเผยแพร่ metadata การกำหนดข้อจำกัดการใช้ข้อมูล และการดูแลการแลกเปลี่ยนข้อมูลที่ยังไม่เปิดสาธารณะ  
   2.3 ระบุว่า การกำกับเช่นนี้ควรถูกออกแบบให้สอดคล้องกับโครงสร้างพื้นฐานภาครัฐที่มีอยู่แล้ว มากกว่าจะพยายามสร้างระบบกลางซ้ำซ้อนขึ้นใหม่ภายในโครงการ

3. **แบบจำลองการดำเนินงานที่เสนอ: ใช้โครงสร้างพื้นฐานภาครัฐเป็นรางหลักของการเผยแพร่และแลกเปลี่ยนข้อมูล**  
   3.1 อธิบายแนวคิดเรื่อง **รางการเผยแพร่ข้อมูล** โดยแยกอย่างน้อยสามกรณี คือ ข้อมูลเปิดสาธารณะ ข้อมูลแลกเปลี่ยนระหว่างหน่วยงานภาครัฐ และข้อมูลใช้ภายใน  
   3.2 ชี้ให้เห็นว่า ข้อมูลที่เปิดเผยสาธารณะควรถูกเชื่อมผ่าน catalog ของหน่วยงานและเชื่อมโยงสู่ช่องทางข้อมูลเปิดระดับชาติ ส่วนข้อมูลที่ยังไม่เปิดควรใช้กลไกแลกเปลี่ยนข้อมูลภาครัฐแบบมีสิทธิ์เข้าถึงตามหน้าที่ และข้อมูลอ่อนไหวควรถูกเก็บและกำกับภายในจนกว่าจะมีความพร้อม  
   3.3 ย้ำข้อสรุปเชิงยุทธศาสตร์ว่า NCAIF ระยะที่ 1 จึงควรทำหน้าที่เป็น **catalog และ clearinghouse เชิงความหมาย** มากกว่าการเร่งสร้างคลังข้อมูลรวมศูนย์ใหม่ทั้งหมดในทันที

4. **โครงสร้างบทบาทและความรับผิดชอบที่ควรมีในระยะที่ 1**  
   4.1 เสนอให้แยกบทบาทอย่างน้อยระหว่าง **เจ้าของข้อมูล**, **ผู้ดูแลข้อมูล**, **ทีมกลางของกรมฯ**, และ **จุดประสานงานจากหน่วยงานแหล่งข้อมูล** เพื่อให้ทุกสินทรัพย์ข้อมูลมีผู้รับผิดชอบที่ชัดเจน  
   4.2 อธิบายว่า บทบาทของทีมกลางมิใช่การรับภาระดูแลข้อมูลทุกชุดแทนหน่วยงานต้นทาง แต่เป็นผู้กำหนดมาตรฐานขั้นต่ำ ดูแลทะเบียนรายการข้อมูลอ้างอิง และควบคุมกระบวนการเผยแพร่ให้เป็นมาตรฐานเดียวกัน  
   4.3 เสนอให้มีรูปแบบ **endorsement authority** หรือคณะรับรองชั่วคราวสำหรับการประกาศชุดข้อมูลอ้างอิงที่แนะนำใช้ในระยะต้น เพื่อป้องกันความกำกวมว่า ข้อมูลใดเป็น baseline ที่ระบบควรชี้แนะต่อผู้ใช้

5. **กติกาขั้นต่ำที่ต้องมีเพื่อให้ระบบเผยแพร่ข้อมูลได้อย่างปลอดภัยและสม่ำเสมอ**  
   5.1 **การจัดชั้นข้อมูลและเส้นทางการเผยแพร่**: ทุกชุดข้อมูลหรือผลิตภัณฑ์ข้อมูลต้องถูกจำแนกว่าเป็นข้อมูลภายใน ข้อมูลแลกเปลี่ยน หรือข้อมูลเปิด พร้อมระบุเส้นทางการเข้าถึงที่ถูกต้อง  
   5.2 **มาตรฐาน metadata ขั้นต่ำ**: ทุกชุดข้อมูลต้องมีข้อมูลอย่างน้อยเรื่องชื่อชุดข้อมูล คำอธิบาย แหล่งที่มา เจ้าของข้อมูล ผู้ดูแลข้อมูล หน่วยวิเคราะห์เชิงพื้นที่ ความถี่การปรับปรุง ระดับความอ่อนไหว และข้อจำกัดสำคัญ  
   5.3 **กติกาการรับรองชุดข้อมูลอ้างอิง**: ต้องมีกระบวนการระบุว่า dataset ใดเหมาะใช้กับวัตถุประสงค์ใด ในระดับพื้นที่ใด และภายใต้ข้อควรระวังใด  
   5.4 **การกำกับหน่วยพื้นที่และ crosswalk**: ต้องกำหนดขอบเขตเชิงพื้นที่หลักสำหรับงานรายงานแต่ละประเภท และถือว่า crosswalk เป็นสินทรัพย์ข้อมูลที่ต้องมีเจ้าของ เวอร์ชัน และคำอธิบายข้อจำกัด  
   5.5 **กติกาความสดใหม่ การตรวจสอบ และประวัติการแก้ไข**: โดยเฉพาะข้อมูลเหตุการณ์และผลกระทบ ต้องมีสถานะการตรวจสอบ วันที่ปรับปรุงล่าสุด และประวัติการแก้ไขอย่างชัดเจน

6. **ลำดับขั้นการทำงานที่เสนอสำหรับการนำข้อมูลเข้าสู่ NCAIF**  
   6.1 ขั้นที่หนึ่ง: ระบุสินทรัพย์ข้อมูลหรือผลิตภัณฑ์ข้อมูลที่จะนำเข้าสู่ระบบ พร้อมเจ้าของข้อมูลและวัตถุประสงค์การใช้งาน  
   6.2 ขั้นที่สอง: จัดชั้นข้อมูลและกำหนดรางการเผยแพร่ ว่าจะเป็นข้อมูลเปิด ข้อมูลแลกเปลี่ยน หรือข้อมูลใช้ภายใน  
   6.3 ขั้นที่สาม: จัดทำ metadata ขั้นต่ำ คำอธิบายข้อจำกัด และข้อมูลเกี่ยวกับความพร้อมใช้  
   6.4 ขั้นที่สี่: ตรวจสอบความถูกต้องและความเหมาะสมเชิงนโยบายหรือเชิงภารกิจ ก่อนตัดสินใจเผยแพร่หรือรับรองเป็น baseline  
   6.5 ขั้นที่ห้า: เผยแพร่ผ่านช่องทางที่เหมาะสม พร้อมกลไกติดตามการปรับปรุง การเปลี่ยนเวอร์ชัน และการรับข้อท้วงติงจากผู้ใช้

7. **ผลผลิตเชิงรูปธรรมที่ควรเกิดขึ้นในระยะที่ 1**  
   7.1 ระบุว่า สิ่งที่ควรเกิดขึ้นไม่จำเป็นต้องเป็นระบบดิจิทัลเต็มรูปแบบทันที แต่ควรเป็นชุดเครื่องมือกำกับขั้นต่ำที่ใช้ได้จริง เช่น แบบฟอร์ม metadata มาตรฐาน ทะเบียนรายการ baseline ที่แนะนำใช้ checklist การกำหนดรางการเผยแพร่ และ template สำหรับข้อมูลเหตุการณ์หรือผลกระทบ  
   7.2 เชื่อมผลผลิตเหล่านี้กับตรรกะของ MVP ที่โครงการได้สังเคราะห์ไว้แล้ว โดยเฉพาะทะเบียนชุดข้อมูลอ้างอิง การเผยแพร่ metadata และกลไกจัดการข้อมูลเหตุการณ์/ความสูญเสีย  
   7.3 ย้ำว่าผลผลิตลักษณะนี้ช่วยให้ผู้ว่าจ้างเห็นความก้าวหน้าในเชิงโครงสร้าง แม้ระบบปลายทางแบบเต็มรูปแบบจะยังอยู่ในระยะถัดไป

8. **ข้อเสนอเชิงดำเนินงานสำหรับช่วงถัดไปของโครงการ**  
   8.1 ระบุว่าช่วงถัดไปควรมุ่งที่การทดลองใช้กติกากับชุดข้อมูลหรือบริการจำนวนน้อยแต่สำคัญก่อน เพื่อทดสอบว่าบทบาท กระบวนการ และมาตรฐานที่เสนอสามารถใช้ได้จริง  
   8.2 เสนอว่าการหารือกับหน่วยงานกลางด้านรัฐบาลดิจิทัลและหน่วยงานเจ้าของข้อมูลควรถูกใช้เพื่อยืนยันรางการเผยแพร่ ข้อจำกัดทางกฎหมาย และความเป็นไปได้ของการแลกเปลี่ยนข้อมูล  
   8.3 ปิดท้ายด้วยข้อสรุปว่า ความสำเร็จของ NCAIF ระยะที่ 1 จะไม่ได้วัดจากจำนวนหน้าเว็บเพียงอย่างเดียว แต่จะวัดจากการที่กรมฯ สามารถเริ่มต้นใช้กติกาชุดเดียวกันในการคัดเลือก อธิบาย เผยแพร่ และเชื่อมโยงข้อมูลสำคัญได้อย่างต่อเนื่อง

## Writing schedule (tight‑loop)

- **Now → 14 Mar:** finalize outline + evidence map; draft Exec Summary + Section 1 skeleton
- **Tone/framing checkpoint:** before drafting the merged [`Section 1.6`](ψ/incubate/DCCE/CRDB/output/2026-03-12-Interim%20Report%20Writing%20Plan.md), confirm that Chapter 1 keeps only the analytical implications of the current landscape while the fuller descriptive material is deferred to Chapter 2
- **Pre-drafting analysis checkpoint for Section 2:** complete the comparison matrix, product landscape table, stakeholder-needs synthesis, use-case clustering, and Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 handoff note before drafting Section 2
- **15–18 Mar:** complete Sections 2–3 drafts; populate inserts
- **19–20 Mar:** consolidate appendices; align formatting with TOR
- **21–22 Mar:** internal review + QA; prepare submission pack
- **23 Mar 10:00:** submit interim report

## Thai appendix outline — CDM, use cases, and sitemap

Purpose:
- prepare three stand-alone appendix sections that carry the full supporting detail which would be too heavy for the main report body
- keep the main report readable while preserving the technical and structural basis behind the draft

Drafting mode:
- Thai formal report prose
- appendix style: more detailed than the main chapters, but still readable as a report section rather than as raw notes

### Appendix Section A — Detailed Conceptual Data Model (CDM)

Objective:
- explain the full CDM in enough detail for review, future system design, and traceability back to the project logic

Proposed structure:

1. **วัตถุประสงค์ของภาคผนวกส่วนนี้**
   - อธิบายว่าเหตุใดจึงต้องแสดงรายละเอียดของ CDM แยกจากเนื้อหาหลัก
   - เชื่อมว่า CDM เป็นโครงสร้างกลางของการจัดระเบียบข้อมูลสำหรับ NCAIF

2. **ภาพรวมของขอบเขตข้อมูลหลักของ CDM**
   - ขอบเขตข้อมูลด้านสภาพภูมิอากาศและตัวขับการเปลี่ยนแปลง
   - ขอบเขตข้อมูลด้านการประเมินความเสี่ยงและผลกระทบ
   - ขอบเขตข้อมูลด้านการประเมินความยืดหยุ่น
   - ขอบเขตข้อมูลด้านการวางแผนและดำเนินการปรับตัว

3. **รายละเอียดของแต่ละ subject area**
   - subject area 1: physical climate
   - subject area 2: risk and impact assessment
   - subject area 3: resilience assessment
   - subject area 4: adaptation planning

4. **รายละเอียดของ sub-domains / entities ภายใน subject area 2**
   - hazard modeling
   - vulnerability and exposure
   - risk assessment outputs
   - impact / loss and damage

5. **ตรรกะการเชื่อมโยงข้อมูลระหว่าง subject areas**
   - การเชื่อมจาก climate drivers ไปสู่ hazard map
   - การเชื่อมจาก exposed assets / vulnerability ไปสู่ risk assessment
   - การเชื่อมจาก risk outputs ไปสู่ adaptation planning และ intervention results

6. **หลักการออกแบบสำคัญของ CDM**
   - determinant neutrality
   - recursive aggregation
   - attribution logic

Numbered outline:

1. **บทนำของหมวด 2**
   - เปิดด้วยเจตนารมณ์ของ TOR 5.3.1–5.3.2 ในฐานะการทบทวนภูมิทัศน์ผลิตภัณฑ์ข้อมูลและฐานข้อมูลในระยะปัจจุบัน
   - วางกรอบว่าเนื้อหาในหมวดนี้มุ่งอธิบายสิ่งที่มีอยู่จริง วิธีที่หน่วยงานต่าง ๆ ใช้และจัดการข้อมูล สิ่งที่ยังขาด และกรณีการใช้งานหลัก
   - ย้ำว่าเป็นการทบทวนเชิงสังเคราะห์สำหรับรายงานความก้าวหน้า ไม่ใช่การอ้างว่าการจัดทำ baseline inventory เสร็จสมบูรณ์แล้ว

2. **2.1 เจตนารมณ์ของ TOR และวัตถุประสงค์ของการทบทวนภูมิทัศน์ผลิตภัณฑ์ข้อมูลในระยะปัจจุบัน**
   - อธิบายว่าเหตุผลของหมวดนี้คือทำให้เห็นสถานะปัจจุบันของผลิตภัณฑ์ข้อมูลและระบบข้อมูลที่มีอยู่
   - เชื่อมว่าหมวดนี้รองรับงานตาม TOR 5.3 โดยไม่ซ้ำกับบทสถาปัตยกรรมใน Chapter 1

3. **2.2 ภาพรวมของผลิตภัณฑ์ข้อมูลและระบบข้อมูลที่มีอยู่ในปัจจุบัน**
   - เริ่มจากภูมิทัศน์ของ DCCE website และระบบที่เกี่ยวข้อง ว่ามีทรัพย์สินข้อมูลจริงจำนวนมาก แต่กระจัดกระจายตามภารกิจและโครงการ
   - อธิบายระบบแผนที่ความเสี่ยงเชิงพื้นที่ในฐานะผลิตภัณฑ์ข้อมูลที่ก้าวหน้าที่สุดในปัจจุบัน โดยแจกแจง 3 ชั้นของผลิตภัณฑ์
   - ขยายไปยังผลิตภัณฑ์และระบบของหน่วยงานคู่สนทนา เช่น พอร์ทัลข้อมูลภัยพิบัติ ระบบสถิติ ศูนย์ข้อมูลเปิด ระบบข้อมูลภาคขนส่ง และเครื่องมือวิเคราะห์ของภาคการเงิน
   - ปิดด้วยข้อสังเกตว่าภูมิทัศน์ปัจจุบันมีสินทรัพย์จริงจำนวนมาก แต่ยังไม่เชื่อมเป็นภาพรวมเดียว

4. **2.3 ลักษณะข้อมูลที่ผู้มีส่วนเกี่ยวข้องเป็นผู้ผลิตหรือดูแล และวิธีการได้มาของข้อมูล**
   - จัดกลุ่มหน่วยงานตามลักษณะการทำงาน ไม่เรียงรายหน่วยงานแบบรายตัว
   - กลุ่มผู้ผลิตข้อมูลปฐมภูมิและข้อมูลธุรการ
   - กลุ่มผู้ประสานข้อมูลและโครงสร้างพื้นฐานข้อมูล
   - กลุ่มผู้ใช้ข้อมูลเชิงนโยบายและเชิงวิเคราะห์
   - อธิบายความแตกต่างของวิธีได้มาของข้อมูล เช่น สำรวจ รายงานตามสายงาน ทะเบียน การเชื่อม API การวิเคราะห์เชิงแบบจำลอง และการดึงจากแหล่งภายนอก

5. **2.4 ความถี่การปรับปรุงข้อมูล ระดับพื้นที่ และข้อจำกัดในการใช้งานจริง**
   - สังเคราะห์เรื่อง cadence การอัปเดตว่าบางระบบเป็น event-driven บางระบบเป็น periodic survey บางระบบเป็นโครงการเฉพาะกิจ
   - อธิบายความต่างด้านระดับพื้นที่ ตั้งแต่ระดับประเทศ จังหวัด อำเภอ ตำบล เทศบาล ไปจนถึงระดับทรัพย์สินหรือจุดเฉพาะ
   - ชี้ข้อจำกัดหลัก เช่น ความไม่ครบถ้วน ความล่าช้า การไม่มี metadata ความไม่สอดคล้องของนิยาม การจำกัดสิทธิ์เข้าถึง และความเสี่ยงในการตีความผิดเกินขอบเขตข้อมูล

6. **2.5 ความต้องการข้อมูลที่หน่วยงานต่าง ๆ ยังขาดอยู่**
   - จัดความต้องการออกเป็นกลุ่มหลักตาม synthesis note
   - ข้อมูลคาดการณ์ระยะยาวและ scenario ที่เชื่อถือได้
   - baseline และตัวชี้วัดมาตรฐานกลาง
   - metadata และ data dictionary
   - ข้อมูลที่ละเอียดสอดคล้องกับระดับการตัดสินใจ
   - ข้อมูลความสูญเสียและความเสียหายทางเศรษฐกิจที่แท้จริง
   - ข้อมูลความเปราะบางและขีดความสามารถในการปรับตัว
   - เส้นทางการเข้าถึงและการเผยแพร่ข้อมูลที่ปลอดภัยและชัดเจน

7. **2.6 กรณีการใช้งานของข้อมูลความเสี่ยงและผลกระทบจากการเปลี่ยนแปลงสภาพภูมิอากาศ**
   - จัด use cases เป็นกลุ่มสังเคราะห์ ไม่เล่าแบบหน่วยงานต่อหน่วยงาน
   - การตอบสนองภัยพิบัติและการประเมินหลังเหตุการณ์
   - การวางแผนท้องถิ่นและการของบประมาณ
   - การคุ้มครองกลุ่มเปราะบางและการจัดบริการสังคม
   - การวางแผนเศรษฐกิจมหภาคและการประเมินระดับชาติ
   - การวางแผนความยืดหยุ่นของโครงสร้างพื้นฐาน
   - การวิเคราะห์ความเสี่ยงของภาคการเงิน
   - ปิดด้วยข้อสังเกตว่า use cases เหล่านี้สะท้อนว่าความต้องการข้อมูลไม่ได้มีเพียงเพื่อการสื่อสาร แต่เพื่อการตัดสินใจจริงในหลายบริบท

8. **2.7 ข้อสังเกตเชิงสังเคราะห์จากการทบทวนภูมิทัศน์ผลิตภัณฑ์ข้อมูลและผลการสัมภาษณ์**
   - สรุปว่าไทยมีผลิตภัณฑ์ข้อมูลและระบบข้อมูลอยู่แล้วจำนวนมาก
   - แต่ข้อมูลและระบบเหล่านี้ยังแยกส่วนกันทั้งในเชิงสถาบัน มาตรฐาน คำอธิบาย และการค้นพบ
   - ชี้ว่าความท้าทายสำคัญไม่ใช่การเริ่มจากศูนย์ แต่คือการจัดระเบียบ เชื่อมโยง อธิบายข้อจำกัด และทำให้ผู้ใช้เลือกใช้ได้อย่างมั่นใจ
   - ส่งต่อเหตุผลอย่างนุ่มนวลไปสู่หมวดถัดไปของรายงานโดยไม่ย้อนกลับไปแบกภาระเชิงสถาปัตยกรรมของ Chapter 1

9. **หลักการเขียนตลอดทั้งหมวด**
   - ใช้ภาษารายงานทางการ อ่านเป็นฉบับส่งผู้ว่าจ้าง
   - เปิดแต่ละหัวข้อด้วยข้อค้นพบเชิงปฏิบัติ ไม่เปิดด้วยกระบวนการวิเคราะห์ภายใน
   - รักษาแนวเขียนแบบสังเคราะห์ ไม่ทำให้เนื้อหาแตกเป็นบันทึกสัมภาษณ์รายหน่วยงาน
   - กล่าวถึงข้อจำกัดของข้อมูลอย่างตรงไปตรงมา แต่ไม่ทำให้น้ำเสียงกลายเป็นบันทึกปัญหาภายในทีม
