# Oracle DB backfill — Group 4 NotebookLM MCP timeouts & environment tuning

## Scope

This canonical learning represents **Group 4 – NotebookLM MCP timeouts & env tuning** from the indexing map in [`plans/2026-04-09-learnings-indexing-map.md`](plans/2026-04-09-learnings-indexing-map.md).

It consolidates the pattern that **NotebookLM MCP timeouts in this environment are primarily mitigated by server‑side timeout and environment tuning** (rather than prompt changes alone): increasing MCP server timeouts, adjusting typing speeds, and disabling certain stealth behaviours.

## Source artefacts

Group 4 member files (from the indexing map):

- [`ψ/memory/learnings/2026-03-04_notebooklm-mcp-timeout-fixed-by-server-env.md`](ψ/memory/learnings/2026-03-04_notebooklm-mcp-timeout-fixed-by-server-env.md)
- [`ψ/memory/learnings/2026-03-04_notebooklm-mcp-timeouts-fixed-by-increasing-serv.md`](ψ/memory/learnings/2026-03-04_notebooklm-mcp-timeouts-fixed-by-increasing-serv.md) **(proposed primary)**

These notes describe the same incident and resolution from slightly different angles; the canonical promotes the general pattern and demotes incident‑specific detail to provenance.

## Stable patterns

- When NotebookLM MCP requests time out, first inspect **server‑side timeouts and environment configuration**, not just prompt content.
- Increase server timeouts for long‑running NotebookLM queries so they can complete without client‑side aborts.
- Adjust typing speeds and disable or relax stealth features that introduce unnecessary delays for MCP traffic.
- Treat NotebookLM MCP as a **stateful web client** that can be sensitive to headless browser settings, network throttling, and other environment toggles.
- Capture successful configuration combinations as reusable presets for future sessions.

## One-off decisions

- For this repository, we treat the March 2026 timeout incident as the reference case and derive a general environment‑tuning pattern from it.
- The canonical note avoids specific numeric timeout values (which may change) and focuses on the decision logic: when and where to tune.

## Open questions

- What monitoring is needed to detect NotebookLM MCP timeouts early (for example, structured logs, metrics, or alerts)?
- Should there be a standard checklist or script for validating MCP environment settings before long NotebookLM research runs?
- How should environment presets be versioned and documented across different projects or machines?

## Relationship to Oracle DB backfill

- Oracle DB should store **one canonical learning** for NotebookLM MCP timeout and environment‑tuning patterns tied to this file.
- Incident‑level notes remain in the markdown corpus but can be treated as superseded.
- Oracle DB backfill should:
  - Create or confirm a `learning` entry linked to this canonical file.
  - Tag it with concepts: `oracle-db`, `notebooklm`, `mcp`, `timeouts`, `environment-tuning`, `reliability`.
  - Record the Oracle ID in [`ψ/memory/logs/info/backfill-index.md`](ψ/memory/logs/info/backfill-index.md) under *Group 4 canonical backfill*.
