# Guardrail — Verify `oracle_learn()` materializes a repo-local learning file

**Date**: 2026-03-27 (Asia/Bangkok)

## Problem

Sometimes an MCP call (e.g., `oracle_learn()`) reports success and returns a target path under `ψ/memory/learnings/…`, but the corresponding markdown file is not present on disk immediately after (observed as `ENOENT` when trying to read it).

## Guardrail (operational implementation)

After every `oracle_learn()` call:

1) **Capture** the returned `file` path from the tool response.
2) **Verify existence** in the working tree by reading the file at that path.
   - If read succeeds: stop (file exists).
   - If read returns `ENOENT`: continue to step 3.
3) **Create the missing file** at the exact returned path and paste the learning content into it (use `apply_patch`, not shell redirection).
4) **Re-read** the created file to confirm it is now on disk.
5) Optionally, run `git status` to ensure it is staged/tracked as expected.

## Notes

- This guardrail is tool-agnostic: it works whether `oracle_learn()` was called directly or indirectly (e.g., via an “important” info logging flow).
- It does not fix the underlying MCP issue; it prevents “invisible” learnings.
