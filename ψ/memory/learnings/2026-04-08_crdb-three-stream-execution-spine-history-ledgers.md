## Pattern

When a planning artifact defines the **execution spine** of a project (for example, “IT discussion → consultation workshop → FGD3”), it must be materialized consistently across the project-management ledgers:

1. **Trigger log** — add a trigger row that names the artifact and date where the spine was adopted (here: T-015 for the three-stream plan), and link to the key evidence (work-streams note, interim report narrative, IT/workshop/FGD anchors).
2. **Change log** — add a change entry that explains, in plain language, what changed in the project direction (“we now treat these three conversations as one staged execution spine”) and which decisions/deliverables are affected.
3. **Deliverable map** — treat the spine-defining plan as a first-class deliverable (D-020), with explicit triggers, decision dependencies, and checkpoints.
4. **Claim register** — add a reusable claim (C-011) that summarizes the rationale for the spine so sponsor-facing notes and future retros do not have to reconstruct the explanation from scratch.

## Why it matters

- It preserves **why** the project chose a particular engagement sequence, not just the fact that those meetings occurred.
- It keeps the execution spine aligned with the **interim report narrative** and TOR interpretation, preventing later drift between story and practice.
- It makes it easier to audit the project later: a reader can jump from the claim to the change entry, the trigger, the plan, and the concrete deliverables without guesswork.

## Reuse guidelines

- Apply the same pattern whenever a new work-stream plan or engagement spine is adopted (e.g., for other DCCE projects or future CRDB phases).
- Do not create “stealth” spines that live only in free-form notes; ensure every such decision shows up as Trigger + Change + Deliverable + Claim.
