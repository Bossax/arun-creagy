# The `/rrr` workflow is incomplete without oracle_learn() sync

## Guardrail

The `/rrr` workflow is incomplete if it writes a retrospective and a learning file but never calls `oracle_learn` with the distilled pattern and tags.

Treat **Oracle sync as a required step** of `/rrr` (and `/fyi --important`):

- After writing a learning under `ψ/memory/learnings/`, immediately call `oracle_learn` with the distilled pattern and tags so the learning is indexed in Oracle and becomes searchable.
- Do not treat a retrospective + local learning file as “done” until the corresponding `oracle_learn` call has succeeded.

If sync is skipped, important lessons remain stranded as local files only and will not appear in Oracle searches.

## Background

This guardrail consolidates and supersedes the earlier observation captured in [`2026-03-25_rrr-skill-oracle-learn-gap.md`](ψ/memory/learnings/2026-03-25_rrr-skill-oracle-learn-gap.md), which first highlighted that `/rrr` was writing learnings without enforcing an Oracle sync step.
