# Learning — CDM review via decision-capture loop

When refining a Conceptual Data Model (CDM), accuracy improves if the workflow is explicitly staged:

1. **Inventory**: Extract every relationship from the ERD into a normalized list.
2. **Flag**: Create a summary table (cardinality + verb phrase + interpretation) and flag ambiguous semantics.
3. **Decide**: Convert flagged items into a markdown-native decision log with clearly articulated options and inline comment slots.
4. **Apply**: Update ERD + entity definitions only after decisions are captured.
5. **Rationale**: Add a short “reasons behind decisions” section to prevent future re-litigation.

This session also reinforced a modeling principle for climate-risk systems:
- **Attribution should be loss-driven**: keep attribution summaries attached to `LOSS_DAMAGE_RECORD` rather than linking events/drivers directly, to avoid encoding speculative causal claims without impact evidence.
