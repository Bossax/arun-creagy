# Learning — CRDB Interim Report Rewrite Planning Pattern (v1 → v2)

## Pattern

When revising a complex interim report under TOR and feedback constraints, it is more effective to invest in a **writing plan + evidence plan pair** than to jump directly into rewriting paragraphs. The writing plan defines the structure, narrative logic, and TOR alignment for the v2 report, while the evidence plan lists only the additional evidence tasks needed on top of the v1 submission and existing artifacts.

Key elements of this pattern:

1. **Rewrite-first constraint**: Treat the first-submission report as the primary content base. The main task for v2 is to rewrite and restructure existing text to satisfy TOR and committee feedback, not to re-synthesize everything from raw notes.
2. **Evidence reuse over expansion**: Anchor evidence rows to the same sources used in the original writing plan (e.g., NCAIF framework notes, governance strategy, interview matrices, FGD summaries) and only add new evidence where explicit gaps exist (e.g., missing lists, counts, or tables required by TOR).
3. **Deep Research as escalation, not default**: Limit Deep Research prompts to high-leverage gaps (in this case, Thailand-focused Task 5.5 literature and dataset lists) and remove them from areas where local artifacts already provide enough material.
4. **Opaque canonical artifacts**: When the v1 report file cannot be read directly by the AI (binary in this environment), treat it as a canonical but opaque base text: planning artifacts should describe how humans will use the PDFs and headings locally rather than pretending full visibility.
5. **Minimal, explicit checklists**: Convert the plan into a small, concrete checklist (e.g., build interview coverage table, produce FGD synthesis, compile List A/B, insert Section 3 table) so that the writing pass can proceed without rethinking the plan each time.

This pattern keeps the revision process bounded, traceable to the original evidence, and respectful of resource constraints on both Deep Research and human drafting time.
