# Learning — CRDB PM reconstruction + workflow compliance

## Pattern
When reconstructing a project’s history, use a **timeline-first staging surface** (neutral, chronological) and then backfill canonical ledgers in this order:
1) **Trigger Log** = history spine (must render correctly and sort chronologically)
2) **Deliverable Map** = artifacts implied/created by triggers
3) **Submission Log** = all freeze points (internal cutoffs) + formal submissions/snapshots

## Operational rules
- Spine surfaces must be **chronologically readable** even if IDs are not sequential.
- Keep “backfill notes” out of tables; keep tables strictly row data.
- Prefer evidence-first linking: reference Evidence Registry IDs when available.

## Reliability rule (process)
If the user invokes `/rrr`, complete the chain end-to-end:
- write retrospective → write learning → oracle sync → git add/commit.

This prevents “silent loss” of session meaning and aligns with “Nothing is Deleted”.
