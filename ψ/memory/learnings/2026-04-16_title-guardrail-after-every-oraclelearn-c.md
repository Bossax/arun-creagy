# Guardrail: After every oracle_learn() call, immediately verify materialisation

## Guardrail

- After every `oracle_learn()` call, treat the returned `file` / `source_file` path as a **claim**, then immediately verify that the file exists on disk.
- If the file is missing (read returns `ENOENT`), treat this as a **serious workflow integrity failure** because it breaks durable capture and creates false confidence in non-existent artifacts.
- On missing file: immediately materialize the referenced learning file at the exact path with the learning content, commit it, and log the incident as a reliability issue.

## Rationale

This guardrail prevents Oracle DB/index entries from becoming "invisible" when the MCP server reports success but does not materialize the backing markdown file in the repo. In this hybrid Windows + Docker + Git Bash environment, we must assume that `oracle_learn` updates Oracle's internal memory but may fail to create a Git-visible file unless we explicitly enforce this check-and-create discipline.

## Provenance

This consolidated guardrail is informed by earlier anomaly and guardrail notes:
