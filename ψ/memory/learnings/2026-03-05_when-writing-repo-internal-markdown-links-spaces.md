# When writing repo-internal markdown links, spaces/parentheses/unicode punctuatio

When writing repo-internal markdown links, spaces/parentheses/unicode punctuation frequently break navigation across renderers. Regex link extraction like `\]\(([^)]+)\)` is unreliable because it truncates at the first `)`. Practical rule: URL-encode parentheses in destinations (`(`→`%28`, `)`→`%29`) and validate links with a parser that balances parentheses (or supports `<...>` destinations + decode) before shipping stakeholder-facing decision packs.
