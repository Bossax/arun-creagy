# Learning — CRDB PM history reconstruction pattern (treat CRDB as a ledgered system)

## Status
This learning exists because it was previously referenced as created but was not materialized on disk.

**Superseded by (more complete):**

## Pattern
To reconstruct CRDB project history in a way that remains maintainable:

1) Build a **neutral, chronological staging timeline** first (timeline-first), using a shared event schema.
2) Backfill canonical PM ledgers from that spine:
   - **Trigger Log** (T-*) as the history spine.
   - **Deliverable Map** (D-*) as the artifact inventory implied by triggers.
   - **Submission Log** (S-*) as freeze points + formal submissions/snapshots.
   - Then **Change Log** (CH-*) and **Claim Register** (C-*) once spine is stable.

## Operational rules
- Ledgers are **append-only**: do not delete rows; supersede with new IDs.
- Tables must be **render-correct** and **sorted chronologically** for human scanning.
- Keep backfill commentary outside tables; tables are for row data only.
- Prefer evidence-first linking: when an Evidence Registry exists, point to E-IDs.

## Why this matters
Treating CRDB as a ledgered system prevents “project history drift” and makes later workstreams reconstructable without re-reading the entire repository.
