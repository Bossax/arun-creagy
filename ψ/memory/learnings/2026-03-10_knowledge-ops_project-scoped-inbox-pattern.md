# Project-scoped inbox pattern (incubate/inbox) prevents global inbox decay

**Pattern**: Keep `ψ/inbox/` as universal capture, then route items into `ψ/incubate/<org>/<project>/inbox/{active,writing_notes}/` when the project thread is known.

## Why it works
- Keeps capture low-friction (drop first, decide later).
- Makes project hubs/plans deterministic entrypoints.
- Preserves evidence while preventing “plan drift”.

## Practical heuristic
- `inbox/active`: sources, onboarding digests, decision evidence, external references.
- `inbox/writing_notes`: drafts and partial notes meant to be promoted into project outputs.

## Failure mode avoided
Global inbox becomes a junk drawer and project plans lose anchors to real inputs.
