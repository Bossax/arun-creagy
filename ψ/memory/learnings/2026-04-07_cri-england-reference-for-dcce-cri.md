# Learning — Using CRI_England as a Reference for DCCE/CRI (2026-04-07)

## Context

- External repo: `github.com/Christine-L-Camacho/CRI_England` (local clone under ghq).
- Session goal: understand how this Community Resilience Index for England can inform the DCCE/CRI project (Thailand) without copying its methodology blindly.

## Key Relations and Insights

### 1. Data packaging pattern

- CRI_England separates its artefacts into three layers:
  - `indicators.csv` — analysis-ready matrix of 42 indicator values at local authority level.
  - `index.csv` — composite and sub-index scores for 307 local authority districts.
  - `indicator_descriptors.xlsx` — metadata for all 44 indicators (including 2 licensed indicators not in the public indicator CSV).
- For DCCE/CRI, an analogous public bundle would be:
  - A derived, cleaned table of **impact and capacity indicators** at the chosen geography (post Fiscal Relief pipeline + post tagging), not raw relief streams.
  - A table of **impact and capacity profile scores** (Phase 1 + Phase 2 outputs).
  - A descriptor/metadata sheet aligned with the **CRI capacity tagging dictionary** and the **evidence registry/coverage map**.

### 2. Methodological contrast (foil, not template)

- CRI_England:
  - Trait/outcome-based composite resilience index (BRIC lineage) at local authority scale.
  - Emphasis on static or slowly changing community conditions as indicators.
- DCCE/CRI design:
  - Phase 1: **Fiscal Relief impact index** with explicit data lineage and Administrative Gap flags.
  - Phase 2: **process- and governance-oriented capacity profiles** (Coping / Adaptive / Transformative), with asset vs process structure and data-richness/confidence overlay.
  - Strong evidence backbone via **CRI-Evidence-Registry** and **CRI-Evidence-Coverage-Map**.
- Therefore CRI_England is best used as a **foil**:
  - To explain what a conventional composite resilience index looks like.
  - To justify CRI Thailand’s shift toward impact + profile-first, evidence-backed outputs.

### 3. Indicator taxonomy cross-check

- CRI_England’s indicator descriptors provide an external catalog of community resilience traits.
- We can cross-walk this catalog against CRI Phase 2’s tagging dictionary to:
  - Spot trait dimensions worth borrowing (e.g., social capital, community cohesion) where operationally and politically feasible.
  - Make explicit which traits we intentionally omit because we prioritise **process, governance, and data reality**.

### 4. Publishing and communication benchmark

- CRI_England demonstrates a minimal but effective publication bundle:
  - Public data repo (CSV + XLSX + README + citation).
  - Simple interactive tool for exploration.
- CRI Thailand’s external communication can reuse this structure while changing the story:
  - Emphasise **profiles, gaps, and evidence links** rather than a single rank.
  - Make the evidence registry and coverage map visible (E-CRI IDs, hearings, syntheses).

## Application to DCCE/CRI

- Treat CRI_England as a **data-packaging and communication benchmark**:
  - Design CRI Thailand’s public data artefacts and interactive front-end with similar clarity.
- Treat it as a **conceptual foil**:
  - Use it in internal/external docs to show why DCCE/CRI is impact- and process-centric rather than purely trait-based.
- Do **not** treat CRI_England’s `indicators.csv` as a one-to-one analogue of our Fiscal Relief pipeline or capacity tagging dictionary:
  - Our closest analogue would be a **derived, tagged indicator table** (impact + capacity indicators with Baseline/Target, asset/process flag, and confidence scores).
