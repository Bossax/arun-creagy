# Learning — Writing-plan anchors need verified dependencies + explicit source hierarchy

When a plan document is intended to be the *anchor* for a writing session, it must be treated like a small system:

## 1) Verify dependencies before making claims
- Before stating that a base text or appendix “does not exist,” do a quick repo check for alternate locations (e.g. `inbox_source/` vs `output/`).
- Wrong path assumptions quickly propagate into workflow recommendations and create avoidable friction.

## 2) Write down a single source hierarchy
If multiple documents (evidence plan vs writing plan) imply different “canonical” sources, resolve it explicitly in one place:
- PDFs = legal/record authority (official wording, counts, record consistency)
- v1 MD under `inbox_source/` = primary base text for drafting/rewrite
- MD under `output/` = working copies / staging

This prevents contradictory interpretations by different writers.

## 3) Centralise process, decentralise verification
- Keep the detailed workflow once (e.g. the 4-step method: locate → rearrange → top up → push detail).
- In per-section instructions and checklists, avoid repeating the process; instead:
  - reference the generic workflow
  - specify required outputs
  - include verifiable QA checks

This makes the plan “just sufficient,” reduces drift, and improves usability under time pressure.
