# Lesson — writing-th Option C skill redesign (Oracle-aligned)

## Pattern

When the user wants Thai drafting that can closely mimic a specific “example report” style **without losing** the Oracle’s stable voice and safety rules, use a layered style system:

1) Example report (session reference) is PRIMARY for terminology + section flow.
2) Write a timestamped **Session Style Pack Summary** into the writing plan (append-only).
3) Apply resonance as safety rails (citations/hedging/no hallucinated sources).
4) Store evolving improvements as learnings and keep stable rules promotion explicit.

## Why it matters

- Prevents “one-size-fits-all resonance” from flattening sponsor-specific voice.
- Makes style decisions auditable and reusable across sessions.
- Keeps human agency via the outline-first stop.

## Operational guardrail

If `oracle_learn()` reports success but no file appears on disk, immediately verify and materialize per:
