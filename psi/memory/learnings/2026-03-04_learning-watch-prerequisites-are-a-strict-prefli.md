# Learning: /watch prerequisites are a strict preflight chain: (1) Mosquitto MQTT 

Learning: /watch prerequisites are a strict preflight chain: (1) Mosquitto MQTT client tools (`mosquitto_pub`/`mosquitto_sub`) must exist on PATH for Gemini automation transport; (2) yt-dlp must have a supported JS runtime configured (Node via `--js-runtimes node`, ideally persisted in `C:/Users/sitth/AppData/Roaming/yt-dlp/config.txt`) to avoid deprecated extraction; (3) captions strategy must distinguish auto-captions vs manual subtitles. Repo helpers: `tools/watch/preflight.sh` -> `output/watch/_preflight.log`, `tools/watch/cc_diag.sh` -> `output/watch/_cc_diag_*.log`.
