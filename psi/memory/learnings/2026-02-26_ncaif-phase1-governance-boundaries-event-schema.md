# Learning — Phase 1 NCAIF requires boundary + event/impact governance (not optional)

When refining NCAIF for Phase 1 delivery, the most “governance-heavy” topics are often the most practical blockers.

## Pattern

If the system will publish maps/dashboards/reports for policy use, then Phase 1 must treat these as first-class deliverables:

- **Canonical boundary governance**: declare authoritative spatial units, version boundary datasets, and define crosswalk rules (admin vs LAO vs future community boundaries).
- **Event/impact schema governance**: standardize “where/when/affected population/assets” fields and record data freshness/lead-time so outputs don’t imply real-time precision.

## Why it matters

- Without boundary clarity, comparisons are misleading and “the same indicator” can mean different geometries.
- Without event/impact schema + freshness metadata, post-event reporting produces false certainty.

## Practical design implication

- A **hybrid NCAIF** (thematic backbone + light persona entry) can reduce user confusion when climate literacy varies, but it must be anchored to a stable taxonomy.

## Governance implementation implication

Package governance as project-fundable work packages:

- Dataset onboarding (metadata + steward + boundary alignment + publish decision)
- Product release (spec + caveats + data contracts)
- Minimal quality checks (validation rules + limitations)
- Legal/sharing readiness (classification + access pathway)
